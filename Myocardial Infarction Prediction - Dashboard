# Myocardial Infarction Prediction Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps in predicting the likelihood of myocardial infarction (heart attack) based on patient demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history, and clinical parameters. It provides insights into key risk factors and assists healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and preventive measures.

### Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Loaded patient dataset (CSV file) into Power BI Desktop.
- **Step 2:** Opened Power Query Editor and enabled "Column distribution," "Column quality," and "Column profile" to check for missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Step 3:** Handled missing values by replacing nulls with median values for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns.
- **Step 4:** Created a calculated column "Risk Category" based on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG readings.
- **Step 5:** Applied filters for key patient parameters such as "Age Group," "Diabetes," "Hypertension (HTN)," and "Smoking Status."
- **Step 6:** Added a card visual to display the total number of patients assessed.
- **Step 7:** Implemented a bar chart to show the distribution of patients across different risk categories.
- **Step 8:** Designed a pie chart to visualize the proportion of patients with high cholesterol levels.
- **Step 9:** Used a pie chart to illustrate the percentage of people falling in different age groups having  heart disease risk.
- **Step 10:** Used conditional formatting to highlight high-risk patients in red for easy identification.

3. **Other Important Parameters:**
   - **Smoking Status:** 63.04% of patients are smokers.
   - **Hypertension (HTN):** 51.09% of patients have hypertension.
   - **Family History:** 27.17% of patients have a family history of myocardial infarction.
   - **Diabetes:** 36.96% of patients have diabetes.
   - **Blood Pressure (BP):** The average BP level among patients is 120.70 mmHg.
